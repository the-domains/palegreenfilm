# Bio

Chad Tremblay studied at the University of Winnipeg for several years, earning a B.A. in filmmaking and history. He has been involved in film and theatre for more than a decade, and has written and directed many short films and documentaries, while working on several other independent and full budget projects.

In this time, Chad filled roles ranging from director of photography and camera operator to sound mixer and picture editor. He has worked in the camera department on big budget hollywood features, produced and directed independent music videos, and even worked as a camera operator and assistant producer on the National Geographic/Discovery Channel series "Monster Moves" for three seasons.

Chad also spent six years working at the University of Winnipeg, instructing students on topics ranging from lighting and exposing film, to in-depth use of industry standard editing software.

He has edited a number of short films that have been requested for screenings at festivals world-wide, and is currently completing post-production on several more short films and music videos -- both his own, and for other local Winnipeg artists.

A passionate musician, Chad spent several years playing and touring with the Winnipeg noise rock band KEN mode, culminating in a Juno Award for Best Metal / Hard Music Album of the year in 2012 (album _Venerable_).
